                <h3>OSI Model</h3>
                <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes 
                    the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. 
                    Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts with the layers above and below it. 
                    The OSI model provides a structured approach to understanding 
                    and designing network protocols and communication systems.
                </p>
                <ol>Here's a brief overview of each layer:<br><br>
                    <li>Physical Layer: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception 
                        of raw unstructured data bits over a physical medium. 
                        It defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional characteristics of the physical 
                        interface between devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data Link Layer: The data link layer handles the reliable transmission 
                        of data frames between directly connected nodes over a physical link. 
                        It provides error detection and correction, flow control, and handles 
                        access to the physical medium. Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and 
                        PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) are examples of data link layer protocols.
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Layer: The network layer enables the routing of data packets across 
                        different networks. It deals with logical addressing and determines the best 
                        path for data delivery based on network conditions and routing protocols. 
                        The IP (Internet Protocol) is a key network layer protocol.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures the reliable and orderly 
                        delivery of data between end systems. It breaks data into smaller segments, 
                        manages end-to-end communication, and provides error recovery, flow control, 
                        and congestion control. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User 
                        Datagram Protocol) operate at this layer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates 
                        communication sessions between applications. It provides synchronization 
                        and dialog control mechanisms to enable seamless communication between 
                        devices. This layer also handles session checkpointing and recovery.
                    </li>
                    <li>Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for data 
                        representation, encryption, compression, and formatting. It ensures that 
                        data sent by the application layer of one system is understandable by the 
                        application layer of another system. This layer deals with data syntax and 
                        semantics.
                    </li>
                    <li>Application Layer: The application layer is the closest layer to the end-user 
                        and provides services directly to user applications. It includes protocols for 
                        various application-level services such as file transfer, email, web browsing, 
                        and remote access. Examples of protocols at this layer include HTTP, SMTP, FTP, 
                        and DNS.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The key idea behind the OSI model is to separate the complex task of network 
                    communication into manageable layers, with each layer focused on specific functions. 
                    This modular approach facilitates interoperability, ease of implementation, and troubleshooting 
                    in network systems.
                </p>
                <p>It's important to note that the OSI model is a conceptual model and does not 
                    necessarily reflect the exact implementation of all networking systems, which 
                    often use a hybrid of various layers and protocols. However, the OSI model 
                    remains a useful reference for understanding network communication and protocols.
