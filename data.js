        body: `
        I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 to start a few hands-on IT projects. 
        I have changed my way of learning from theory about protocols and programming languages syntax
        to hardware, software and coding practical projects about what I would like to make.
        Is it a good idea start with a single-board computer? Why not? It is always a good idea start with something.
        For a beginner in embedded systems as myself, single-board computers are better for complex projects requiring
        a full OS and higher-level programming like Python which I know enough to be confidence to start any project.
        Microcontrollers like Arduino, on the other hand, are suited for single-function tasks with real-time control, and
        hardware interaction. I love microcontrollers as well as a way to learn fundamental embedded concepts and low-level
        control of hardware programming in C/C++. My goal using SBC and Microcontrollers is improve my skills about software
        and hardware, two sides of the same coin: Linux Operating Systems, IT Networks, Programming Languages such as Python, 
        C/C++, and Electronics building hands-on projects.
